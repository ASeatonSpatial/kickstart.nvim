Here is some text.

```{r}
# K is otter "hover" documentation.
# Not a real buffer but does show you documentation
print(

myfun = function(){
  return(100)
}
myfun()
```

Here is a plot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(x = runif(10),
                y = runif(10))
ggplot(df) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y))
# This is an R comment
```

<!-- Not sure how to get the full LSP  -->
<!-- functionality (code styling etc) within -->
<!-- an r code chunk. -->

Here is an equation
$$
f(x) = \int x^2 \mathrm{d}x 
$$
To find keymap search nabla in quarto.lua

Also let's see how an inline equation like $f(x) = \Pi_j \delta(x_j)$
